# --- Production (VPS) targets — see DEPLOY.md for full context and one-time setup ---

# deploy-up, since nginx refuses to boot at all with missing cert files (config loads
# atomically) — see DEPLOY.md step 2.

# Manual cert renewal — the cron job (see deploy-cron-install below) calls certbot/renew.sh
# directly; this target is the same script, for running it by hand. Renews every cert
# Certbot manages, so it covers both domains in one call.
deploy-renew:
	./certbot/renew.sh

# One-time: installs certbot/crontab's renewal schedule into this user's real crontab.
# Merges rather than replaces — this VPS runs cron jobs for other projects too, and a
# plain `crontab < file` would wipe those out. Safe to re-run; it replaces only its own
# previous entry (matched by the certbot/renew.sh path) instead of adding a duplicate.
deploy-cron-install:

# Routine "redeploy everything" after a `git pull` — production counterpart to `all` above.
# Rebuilds the frontend static site and the backend image, then brings the stack up.
# Does NOT bootstrap certs — that's a one-time-only first-deploy step (deploy-certs-bootstrap),
# and re-running --standalone here would conflict with nginx already holding port 80.

# DB
# `make db` drops you into the postgres container's shell. From there, connect to the
# actual database with:
#   psql -U app -d app
# Once in psql, useful commands:
#   \dt                                     list tables
#   \d beta_signups                         describe a table's columns
#   SELECT * FROM beta_signups;             view beta signups
#   SELECT * FROM developer_signups;        view developer signups
#   \q                                      quit psql (then `exit` to leave the shell)
db:
	docker compose exec postgres sh

# Same as above but skips the intermediate shell — drops straight into psql.
db-sql:
	docker compose exec postgres psql -U app -d app
